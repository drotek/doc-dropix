Some devices are **mandatory** in order to get your drone to fly using the Dropix autopilot. Here is a quick list of these necessary items:

* ESC / Motor couple
* Arming switch
* Buzzer
* LED Module
* Power Management Unit

You will find more informations on these items in this book. You will also need a **ÂµSD Card** to get your autopilot to be able to run its firmware.
