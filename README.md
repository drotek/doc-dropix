# Introduction

The Dropix Autopilot is the flagship of the French electronics engineering company **Drotek**. Initially developped by Drotek's CEO Jérôme Périn on himself, it has been since improved multiple times so that it reached today, with its 2.1 version, a very high level of accuracy and reliability. Users and companies from all around the world use it for multiple purposes, such as photography, exploration, safety watching, rescuing, and many other applications. In this book you will find out how to use the Dropix autopilot efficiently, what is possible with it, and what devices you should operate it with.
