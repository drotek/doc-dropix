The FMU is an **STM32F427VIT6** microchip from \_ST-Electronics\_, picked for it's great versatility, offering great power and responsiveness with its ARM速 32-bit Cortex速-M4 CPU running **a real-time NuttX operating system**. The IO processor is an **STM32F100C8T6B** microchip, interacting with all inputs and outputs on the board with its ARM速Cortex速-M3 32-bit RISC core. It allows a fast communication with the external devices and the FMU for the best performances. It comes with four sensors, an ST Micro **L3GD20** 3-axis 16-bit Gyroscope, an ST Micro **LSM303D** 3-axis 14-bit Accelerometer/Magnetometer, Invensense's **MPU 6000** 3-axis Accelerometer/Gyroscope, and an MEAS **MS5611** pressure sensor. All together, they provide the autopilot with two accelerometers, two gyroscopes, one magnetometer and one pressure sensor. This offers incredible performances when in flight, for self-guided missions, as well as manually controlled flights. Its simple connectivity with pin headers allows great compatibility with most devices and easy connectivity to the motors, external sensors, and all other devices such as GPS receiver, airspeed sensor, arming switch, etc...
