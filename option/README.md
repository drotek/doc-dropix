# Optional devices

There are devices that can provide more functionalities to your machine depending on your needs and application. For instance, most users will rely on a **GPS module** to enable the use of RTL for automatic return and landing, or getting an accurate _Loiter mode_ flight. You can use a **telemetry system** to command your machine though MAVLink from a Ground control station \(ie. a computer with QGC or Mission Planner running\), or regroup your arming switch, LED module and buzzer into a smartly designed **all-in-one module**, or achieve centimeter accurate missions using an **RTK kit** from Drotek. The architecture from both Ardupilot and PX4 used with the Dropix autopilot will allow many possible configurations and setups.
