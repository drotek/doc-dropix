# RTK modules

The RTK technology and technique is a new positioning technique that allows, through the use of a couple of GNSS receivers, one as the Base, and the second one as the Rover, to compute exact positions that are centimeter accurate! It has been brought to the general market in the recent past years, and Drotek sells numerous modules that can provide that technology to your machine, and be used with the Dropix autopilot.
